## Project Title
GBDA302 Side Quest Week 2: Panic Slide

FORKED: GBDA302 Week 2 Example 3: Platforms (AABB Collisions)

---
## Description
> Modifies the example's movement code to make the blob slide uncontrollably in a linear way.
> The environment is now boxed in with a singular opening.
> Slide around the environment to push and break objects to reach the exit on the right.
> The idea was inspired partially by the bonus challenge as well as old Nitrome flash games I would play as a kid. 

Original Description:
> Adds several rectangular platforms.
> The blob is drawn as a noisy circle but collides using a simple axis-aligned bounding box (AABB). X and Y are resolved separately to keep behaviour predictable and teachable.

## Interaction Instructions
Describe how to use or play your project.
- How does the user start?
- What controls or keys do they use?
- Any important visual or audio feedback to watch for?

> Use the arrow keys `←↑↓→` to slide and slam in that direction.
> Once you colide with an object you stop.
> Objects each respond differently to collisions.
